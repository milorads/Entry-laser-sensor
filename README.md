# Entry-laser-sensor
Arduino program that uses 2 lasers and 2 photoresistors to calculate the pass through the door (or in between any two other points that it was set up at, but it is meant for door that only one person can pass through at a time). On each pass there is sound signal on buzzer and as long as there are people in the room the light (LED) will be lit.

Will translate the comments to english and add requirements and scheme.
